Simple test appa for WebGPU with Emscripten.
Tested with Emscripten 3.1.34 and Chrome Canary 113.0.566x.x on macOS and Windows.

cd 01_blue_triangle
mkdir build
emcmake cmake -B build .
cmake --build build

To debug as shown in https://developer.chrome.com/blog/wasm-debugging-2020/ add -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug when configuring.

01_blue_triangle

* Blue triangle with perspective projection.
* Handles canvas resizing.
* Depth/stencil set up as well although not really needed.
* Simple vertex and uniform buffer setup. (mappedAtCreation, writeBuffer)

02_rotating_triangle

* Now with vertex colors and rotating.
* Uniform buffer update handled via staging buffer ring.
