Simple test apps for WebGPU with Emscripten.
Tested with Emscripten 3.1.51 and Chrome 120.0.6099.109.

cd 01_blue_triangle
mkdir build
emcmake cmake -B build .
cmake --build build
emrun --browser chrome blue_triangle.html

To debug as shown in https://developer.chrome.com/blog/wasm-debugging-2020/ add -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug when configuring.
